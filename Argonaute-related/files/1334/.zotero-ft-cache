Abstract

The slicer activity of the RNA-induced silencing complex resides within its Argonaute (Ago) component, in which the PIWI domain provides the catalytic residues governing guide-strand mediated site-specific cleavage of target RNA. Here we report on structures of ternary complexes of Thermus thermophilus Ago catalytic mutants with 5′-phosphorylated 21-nucleotide guide DNA and complementary target RNAs of 12, 15 and 19 nucleotides in length, which define the molecular basis for Mg 2+ -facilitated site-specific cleavage of the target. We observe pivot-like domain movements within the Ago scaffold on proceeding from nucleation to propagation steps of guide–target duplex formation, with duplex zippering beyond one turn of the helix requiring the release of the 3′-end of the guide from the PAZ pocket. Cleavage assays on targets of various lengths supported this model, and sugar-phosphate-backbone-modified target strands showed the importance of structural and catalytic divalent metal ions observed in the crystal structures.

Main

Ago is the key component of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) and has an essential role in guide-strand-mediated target RNA recognition, cleavage and product release 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 . Ago adopts a bilobal architecture, composed of amino-terminal PAZ-containing (N and PAZ) and carboxy-terminal PIWI-containing (Mid and PIWI) lobes. The PIWI domain adopts an RNase H fold 9 , 10 , 11 , in which the catalytic Asp-Asp-Asp/His residues contribute to slicer activity 11 , 12 , 13 ; the Mid domain sequesters the 5′-phosphate of the guide strand 14 , 15 ; and the PAZ domain recognizes the 2-nucleotide overhang at the 3′-end of the guide strand 16 , 17 . Ago-mediated target-RNA cleavage requires Watson–Crick pairing between guide and target, spanning both the seed segment (positions 2–8) and the cleavage site (10–11 step) as counted from the 5′-end of the guide strand 3 , 4 . Endonucleolytic cleavage is mediated by Mg 2+ cations 18 , 19 and generates fragments containing a 3′-OH for the 5′-segment and a 5′-phosphate for the 3′-segment 20 . Molecular insights into target RNA recognition and cleavage have emerged from chemical 21 , 22 , biophysical 23 and structural 5 , 24 , 25 , 26 , 27 studies, with potential application of RNA-interference-based approaches as a therapeutic modality against a range of human diseases 28 , 29 .

We have previously reported on crystal structures of T. thermophilus Ago bound to 5′-phosphorylated 21-nucleotide guide DNA (binary complex) 30 , and with added 20-nucleotide target RNA (ternary complex) 31 (see Supplementary Materials for a summary of these results). A major limitation of the earlier structural study of the ternary complex 31 was that the bases of the target RNA could not be monitored owing to disordered electron density at the 10–11 cleavage site as a result of mismatch incorporation at these steps to prevent cleavage activity. The catalytic activity of the RNase H fold of the PIWI domain of T. thermophilus Ago originates in Asp residues 478, 546 and 660, and hence, in the present study, single Asp to Asn, Glu or Ala mutants were incorporated at these positions to inhibit the cleavage activity. The ternary complexes of these catalytic mutants with bound guide DNA and varying target RNA lengths were then generated with 5′-phosphorylated 21-nucleotide guide DNA and fully complementary target RNAs of varying length (12, 15 and 19 nucleotides)—conditions under which both the seed segment and the cleavage site could be potentially monitored, thereby providing insights into cleavage mechanism.
Cleavage site in Ago ternary complexes

We have solved the 2.6 Å crystal structure of the Asn 546 catalytic mutant of T. thermophilus Ago bound to 5′-phosphorylated 21-nucleotide guide DNA and a 12-nucleotide target RNA that is fully complementary along the length of the duplex ( Fig. 1a ). This is our highest resolution structure of a ternary complex to date ( Fig. 1b ; stereo view in a different perspective in Supplementary Fig. 1a ; X-ray statistics are listed in Supplementary Table 1 ), and has provided detailed insights into the alignment of the guide and target strands that span both the seed segment and the cleavage site. The guide DNA strand in red can be monitored from positions 1–12 spanning the 5′-half and for positions 20–21 at the 3′-end, whereas the target RNA strand in blue can be monitored for positions 2′–12′ ( Fig. 1b ). Both ends of the guide strand are anchored in their respective binding pockets despite formation of an 11-base-pair (bp) DNA–RNA duplex. Intermolecular contacts within the 12-nucleotide target ternary complex are highlighted in Supplementary Fig. 2 . Bases 1 and 2 are splayed, with thymine at position 1 stacked over the side chain of Arg 418, and its N3 nitrogen and O4 oxygen hydrogen-bonded to the backbone (Met 413) and the side chain (Asn 436) of the Ago scaffold ( Fig. 1c ). Base 1 is the only residue on the guide strand that makes base-specific contacts with the Ago scaffold, and this observation is consistent with the reported sorting of small RNAs in Arabidopsis Ago complexes by the 5′-terminal nucleotide 32 , 33 .

The guide DNA–target RNA duplex spanning positions 2 to 12 ( Fig. 1d ) superpositions better with an A-form helix than with its B-form counterpart ( Supplementary Fig. 3a and b , respectively), with the scissile phosphate (10–11 step) on the target strand positioned opposite the catalytic residues (Asp 478, Asp 660 and Asn 546 mutant) of the RNase H fold of the PIWI domain ( Fig. 1d, e ). Bases 10 and 11 of the target strand stack on each other in a catalytically competent helical conformation in the ternary Ago complex ( Fig. 1f ), in contrast to the orthogonal arrangements of these bases owing to the insertion of Arg 548 between them in the binary Ago complex 30 (compare Supplementary Fig. 4a (binary) with 4b (ternary) ). Conformational changes in both the guide strand ( Supplementary Fig. 5a ) and Ago ( Supplementary Fig. 5b ) accompany the transition from binary to ternary complex formation ( Supplementary Fig. 6 and Supplementary Movie 1 ).
Release of guide 3′-end from PAZ pocket

Next we solved the 3.05 Å crystal structure of the Glu 546 catalytic mutant of T. thermophilus Ago bound to 5′-phosphorylated 21-nucleotide guide DNA and a 15-nucleotide target RNA that is fully complementary along the length of the duplex ( Fig. 2a ; stereo view in Supplementary Fig. 1b ; X-ray statistics are listed in Supplementary Table 1 ). The guide DNA strand can be monitored from positions 1–16, whereas the target RNA strand can be monitored from positions 2′–15′ ( Fig. 2b ). The 5′-phosphate of the guide strand is still anchored in the Mid pocket, but the 3′-end (positions 17–21 are disordered and cannot be traced) is released from the PAZ pocket on formation of the 14-bp duplex spanning positions 2–15 of the guide strand. The molecular basis for the release of the 3′-end of the guide strand is that the helical conformation for nucleotides 12–15 disallows the 3′-end from reaching the binding pocket in the PAZ domain.

We observe conformational changes on proceeding from the ternary Ago complex with bound 12-nucleotide target ( Fig. 2c ) to its counterpart with bound 15-nucleotide target ( Fig. 2d ), and these changes can be visualized after superpositioning of the PIWI-containing (Mid and PIWI) lobe as shown by the yellow arrow in Fig. 2e (also see Supplementary Movie 2 ). These changes involve a pivotal rotation of the PAZ domain (compare PAZ domain alignments in Supplementary Fig. 7a and b ), as well as movement of loops L1 and L2 located on the nucleic-acid-interfacing surface of the PIWI domain ( Fig. 2f ).

Details of intermolecular contacts between loop L1 and the guide DNA 11–12 segment in the 12-nucleotide target RNA ternary complex are shown in Fig. 2g , whereas intermolecular contacts between loops L1 and L2 and the guide DNA 11–15 segment in the 15-nucleotide target RNA ternary complex are shown in Fig. 2h . Notably, L1 changes from a loop ( Fig. 2g ) to a β-turn ( Fig. 2h ) on proceeding from the 12- to the 15-nucleotide target RNA ternary complexes, resulting in several extra hydrogen bonds within this β-turn and with loop 2, thereby stabilizing this new conformation. The conformational transitions in loops L1 and L2 are required to avoid steric clashes with the DNA guide strand ( Supplementary Fig. 8 ) on addition of three more base pairs on proceeding from the 12- to the 15-nucleotide target RNA ternary complexes. Unexpectedly, changes in the conformation of loop L1 force the attached β-strand encompassing residues 489–493, as part of a multi-stranded β-sheet, to slide by a single residue with the accompanying flip of the entire β-strand and its side chains, on proceeding from the 12- to the 15-nucleotide target ternary complex ( Fig. 2i , identified by a black double-edged arrow in Fig. 2f and Supplementary Fig. 9 ).

In mechanistic terms, we favour the view that the conformational transitions in loops L1 and L2 and associated sliding and flipping of the β-strand are triggered by widening of the substrate-binding channel between the PIWI and N domains to accommodate a lengthening of the A-form duplex from 11-bp in the 12-nucleotide target RNA complex to 14-bp in the 15-nucleotide target RNA complex. Such changes not only push the PAZ domain away but also release the 3′ end of guide strand from the PAZ-binding pocket ( Figs 1b , 2b and Supplementary Fig. 7 ). Moreover, we note that sliding and flipping of the β-strand occurs with minimal perturbation of β-sheet formation (schematic in Supplementary Fig. 9 ), and flipping of the entire β-strand does not disrupt specific side-chain interactions.

We have compared the structures of Ago mutant ternary complexes with 12-nucleotide ( Fig. 1b ) and 15-nucleotide ( Fig. 2b ) target RNAs reported in this study with the previously reported structure of the ternary complex of wild-type Ago with 20-nucleotide target RNA containing a pair of mismatches at the cleavage site 31 . The previous structure of the ternary complex (two molecules in the asymmetric unit) 31 and one solved recently in a different crystal form (one molecule in the asymmetric unit; X-ray crystallographic statistics in Supplementary Table 2 ) in which segment 2–9 is fully paired and both ends of the guide strand are anchored, are most similar to the ternary complex with 12-nucleotide target RNA in the present study, in which segment 2–12 is fully paired and both ends of the guide strand are also anchored (comparison outlined in Supplementary Fig. 10a, b ).

Our studies resolve a mechanistic issue related to guide-strand-mediated recognition and cleavage of target RNA within Ago complexes. Several groups have proposed a ‘two-state’ model in which the guide strand is anchored at both of its ends during the nucleation step of target recognition, but its 3′-end is released from the PAZ pocket owing to topological constraints, after propagation of the duplex towards the 3′-end of the guide strand 4 , 11 , 34 . An alternative ‘fixed-end’ model proposed that both ends of the guide strand remain anchored during the nucleation and the propagation steps of RNA recognition 34 . Our results support a two-state mechanism for the system under study, given that our structures demonstrate that both ends of the guide strand are anchored in a ternary complex containing one turn of the A-form helix (12-nucleotide target RNA) spanning the seed segment and cleavage site ( Fig. 1b ), but the 3′-end is released from the PAZ pocket on extending this duplex by three more base pairs (15-nucleotide target RNA) towards the 3′-end of the guide strand ( Fig. 2b ).
N domain blocks guide–target pairing beyond position 16

The 2.8 Å crystal structure of the Asn 478 catalytic mutant of T. thermophilus Ago bound to 5′-phosphorylated 21-nucleotide guide DNA and a 19-nucleotide target RNA (sequence in Fig. 3a , structure in Fig. 3b , stereo view in Supplementary Fig. 1c ; X-ray statistics are listed in Supplementary Table 1 ) is similar to the Ago(Glu 546) catalytic mutant ternary complex with 15-nucleotide target RNA ( Fig. 2b ), except that one extra base pair can be traced, allowing monitoring of 15-bp of guide–target duplex spanning positions 2–16 of the guide strand (stereo electron density maps of the guide and target strands are shown in Supplementary Fig. 11 ). Intermolecular contacts within the 19-nucleotide target ternary complex are highlighted in Supplementary Fig. 12 ). Furthermore, the sugar-phosphate backbone of the target strand is intact at the 10–11 step, and on either side of it, for both 15- and 19-nucleotide target ternary complexes (see F o  -  F c omit maps contoured at 3.7σ in Supplementary Fig. 13a and b , respectively).

An unexpected mechanistic insight to emerge from our structural studies of the three ternary Ago complexes outlined earlier is that the guide DNA–target RNA duplex retains the A-form duplex architecture spanning the seed segment, the cleavage site and observable elements towards the 3′-end of the guide strand (up to position 16), and it is solely the Ago scaffold that adjusts by pivot-like domain movements, to relieve the topological stress associated with zippering up the RNA target through pairing with its guide-strand template. A second unanticipated observation is that the N domain blocks propagation of the guide DNA–target RNA duplex beyond position 16 in the 19-nucleotide target ternary complex ( Fig. 3c ), with the base at position 16 of the guide strand stacking on the aromatic ring of Tyr 43, and the base at 16′ of the target strand stacked over the Pro 44 ring. Thus, base pairing is disrupted for steps 17, 18 and 19, with anticipated trajectories for the separated guide and target strands schematized in Supplementary Fig. 14 .

The sugar-phosphate backbone spanning the seed segment of the guide but not the target strand is hydrogen-bonded to the protein (see Supplementary Movie 3 ). We also note that the sugar-phosphate backbone of the target RNA spanning the 10′–13′ segment forms intermolecular hydrogen bonds with the Ago scaffold in the 12-nucleotide ( Supplementary Fig. 15a ), 15-nucleotide ( Supplementary Fig. 15b ) and 19-nucleotide ( Fig. 3d ) target ternary complexes, establishing the potential for photochemically facilitated cross links between this segment of the target RNA and its spatially identified proximal sites on the protein 35 .
A pair of Mg 2+ cations mediates cleavage chemistry

The PIWI domain of Ago adopts an RNase H fold 9 , 10 , 11 , 30 , 31 , with catalytic Asp 478, Asp 546 and Asp 660 residues lining the active site of the T. thermophilus enzyme. Two Mg 2+ cations have been shown to facilitate RNA hydrolysis during catalytic cleavage by RNase-H-containing nucleases, with cation A assisting nucleophilic attack by positioning and activating a water molecule, and cation B stabilizing the transition state and leaving group 36 , 37 . Because catalytic mutations could induce distortions of the optimal geometry for coordination to divalent cations, we attempted to identify bound Mg 2+ cation(s) in the catalytic pocket of the ternary complex of wild-type T. thermophilus Ago with 19-nucleotide target RNA, that is fully complementary to positions 2–19 of the guide strand ( Fig. 3a ).

Crystals of the Ago ternary complex were grown as a function of Mg 2+ concentration, with 3.3 Å data sets collected for crystals in 50 mM Mg 2+ (space group P 4 3 2 1 2, one molecule in the asymmetric unit) and 80 mM Mg 2+ (space group P 2 1 2 1 2 1 , two molecules in asymmetric unit) solution (X-ray statistics listed in Supplementary Table 3 ). Gel electrophoresis of the crystals established that the target RNA was not cleaved in either complex, presumably because T. thermophilus Ago-mediated cleavage is optimal at higher temperatures and has a marked preference for Mn 2+ over Mg 2+ (ref. 11 ). The F o  - F c omit maps (blue colour, contoured at 3.5σ) of the target strand residues 9′–12′ and catalytic Asp residues for the Ago ternary structures in 50 mM Mg 2+ and 80 mM Mg 2+ are shown in Fig. 3e and f , respectively. A single bound Mg 2+ , positioned towards the leaving group side of the scissile phosphate (cation B) can be identified in the structure in 50 mM Mg 2+ ( Fig. 3e , omit map contoured in purple at 6.0σ), with an intact target RNA readily traceable for the 9′–12′ segment. A pair of Mg 2+ cations separated by 3.9 Å, which coordinate the hydrolysis of the scissile phosphate, were identified in the structure in 80 mM Mg 2+ ( Fig. 3f ). The assignment of the extra density to Mg 2+ site(s) at 3.3 Å resolution is based on coordination of the divalent cation(s) to several oxygen atoms in an approximate octahedral geometry (stereo views in Supplementary Fig. 16a, b ). Of the three catalytic Asp residues lining the catalytic pocket, only Asp 478 coordinates to both Mg 2+ cations ( Fig. 3f and Supplementary Fig. 16b ). The structures of the catalytic residues, Mg 2+ sites and RNA backbone for B. halodurans RNase H (1.85 Å) and T. thermophilus Ago (3.3 Å) complexes are superpositioned in stereo for comparative purposes in Supplementary Fig. 17 . Given that the crystals of the ternary complexes grown from both 50 and 80 mM Mg 2+ diffract to 3.3 Å resolution, it is at present not possible to identify the position of the water molecule that would participate and be positioned for in-line attack on the scissile phosphate.

We observe detectable conformational changes after superpositioning of the single and the pair of Mg 2+ -bound ternary complex structures through their PIWI-containing lobes. These changes are restricted to the PAZ domain ( Supplementary Fig. 18a ) and the target RNA strand ( Supplementary Fig. 18b ). The catalytic residues are optimally positioned for cleavage in the structure of the ternary complex with a pair of Mg 2+ cations.

Thus, the Ago protein, capitalizing on the RNase H fold of its PIWI domain 9 , 10 , 11 , uses three catalytic Asp residues and two Mg 2+ cations to facilitate site-specific cleavage of RNA targets, yielding products containing 5′-phosphate and 3′-OH ends 20 , a feature in common with members of the retroviral integrase superfamily 37 .
Analysis of the catalytic activity of T. thermophilus Ago

Target RNA cleaving bacterial complexes are most effectively reconstituted using single-stranded guide DNA rather than RNA 11 , 15 , 30 , 31 . To explore whether DNA might also function as a target, we subjected chemically synthesized DNA and RNA targets ( Supplementary Table 4 ) to DNA-guided Ago cleavage reactions. DNA is resistant to hydrolysis by divalent metal ions and high temperature incubation, thereby yielding a clearer picture of target cleavage. T. thermophilus Ago loaded with guide DNA derived from luciferase sequence studied previously 30 , 31 cleaved DNA as well as RNA targets; however, several unexpected minor cleavage products were also observed ( Supplementary Fig. 19 ). These side products resulted from partial self-complementarity of the guide DNA, leading to cleavage of guide DNA during the Ago loading process and acceptance of the shorter cleavage products as guide DNAs. We therefore tested new guide and target sequence pairs, identical to the microRNA let-7 sequence selected for crystallography. The let-7 guide and target molecules yielded a single cleavage band, with DNA being a better substrate than RNA ( Supplementary Fig. 20a ). Target DNA cleavage occurred in the presence of Mg 2+ or Mn 2+ , but not Ca 2+ ( Supplementary Fig. 20b ), supporting single and multiple turnover ( Supplementary Fig. 20c ). Cleavage products started to accumulate after a short (about 2 min) lag phase, at an approximate rate constant of 0.1 min -1 under single turnover (0.5 μM target) and 0.2–0.4 min -1 under multiple turnover (5 μM target) conditions ( Supplementary Fig. 20c ). These rate constants indicate that our cleavage conditions are approaching substrate saturation and that product release is not rate limiting. We also included cleavage experiments using mutant Ago proteins that were used for the crystal structures ( Figs 1 , 2 , 3 ) and tested for DNA-guided RNA ( Supplementary Fig. 21a ) or DNA ( Supplementary Fig. 21b ) target cleavage. Of the mutant Agos, only the Asn 546 mutant showed some residual activity, and product formation was reduced >500-fold.
Minimal target DNA requirements

Previously, we showed that luciferase guide DNA strands as short as 9 nucleotides promoted target RNA cleavage; the minimal target length was not addressed 31 . We first shortened the let-7 DNA target ( Fig. 4a ) from its 5′ end ( Fig. 4b ). Truncation of the target to 16 nucleotides did not alter cleavage activity, but 15- and 14-nucleotide targets showed 120- and 400-fold reduced cleavage rates, respectively, and a 12-nucleotide target was not cleaved. This indicates that residues 17′ and higher do not contribute to cleavage, and was further supported by our finding that 21- or 24-nucleotide DNA targets, in which regions 17′–21′ or 17′–24′ were unpaired with same size guides, showed similar activity compared to their fully paired versions ( Supplementary Fig. 22 ).

To examine the importance of the 3′ end of the target, we tested 15-nucleotide DNA target strands displaced in 1-nucleotide steps relative to the let-7 target ( Fig. 4c ). DNA targets covering 2′–16′, 3′–17′ and 4′–18′ showed cleavage activity similar or better than 21-nucleotide-long targets, but 100- and 500-fold reduced rates were obtained for targets covering 5′–19′ and 6′–20′. These experiments indicate that positions 1′ to 3′ were dispensable for target cleavage.

In summary, positions 4′ to 16′ need to be paired to facilitate efficient target DNA cleavage when presented to T. thermophilus Ago loaded with 21-nucleotide guide DNA. On the other hand, guide DNA as short as 9 nucleotides promoted T. thermophilus Ago cleavage of target RNA, indicating that base-pairing involving residues 10′ to 16′ per se is not essential. Short guides, in contrast to 21-nucleotide guides, are unable to occupy the PAZ domain with their 3′ ends. Therefore, we speculate that transitioning of the Ago ternary complex into a cleavage-active conformation requires either the release of the guide 3′-end PAZ interaction or its initial absence as seen for short guide strands. Release of the PAZ guide 3′-end interactions is driven by base-pairing including position 16′ of a target.

It may seem surprising that the Ago conformation of the 15- and 19-nucleotide target-RNA-containing structures were similar. However, the thermodynamic stability of DNA–RNA duplexes is different from DNA–DNA duplexes 38 , and fewer but more stable base pairs may facilitate the switch to the active conformation. In support of this view, we observed that the cleavage activity for the 15-nucleotide (positions 1′–15′) and a 16-nucleotide (positions 1′–16′) target RNAs ( Supplementary Fig. 23 ) only differed by 1.4-fold and was comparable to that of the longer target RNA ( Supplementary Fig. 21 ).

Our crystal structures also indicated that base pairs involving positions 17′ or higher could not form owing to steric clashes with the N-terminal domain. To test whether propagation of the duplex beyond position 16′ could contribute to catalysis, we tested Ago deletion mutants del(1–106) and del(1–177) but found that they lost all activity ( Supplementary Fig. 21a, b ). This suggests that the N domain also has a crucial involvement in transitioning or stabilizing the active conformation of the ternary complex, and could possibly even affect other steps including loading of the guide DNA, which were not tested.
Target DNA sugar-phosphate backbone role during cleavage

To assess the contribution of sugar and phosphate residues during target DNA recognition and cleavage, we introduced 2′-hydroxyl (OH) and 2′-methoxy (Ome) modifications at positions 9′, 10′ or 11′, as well as 2′-fluoro (F) at positions 10′ or 11′ ( Fig. 5a , Supplementary Fig. 24 and Supplementary Table 4 ). OH, Ome and F 2′-modified ribonucleosides favour the A-helical C3′-endo ribose conformation, whereas deoxynucleotides are preferable in the B-helical C2′-endo conformation 39 , and therefore stabilize double-helical structures. The most profound effects on cleavage were shown by 2′-substitutions at residue 11′, which are immediately adjacent to the cleaved phosphodiester bond. The 2′-F substitution enhanced the single ( Fig. 5a ) and multiple ( Supplementary Fig. 24 ) turnover cleavage rate by approximately 4- and 6-fold, respectively, compared to 2′-H, presumably because the electronegative 2′-F group is able to stabilize the developing negative charge of the 3′ oxygen leaving group during the transition state. The cleavage rate was reduced twofold by 2′-OH at residue 11′, and 2′-Ome completely abrogated cleavage, presumably by affecting the hydration pattern optimal for stabilization of the transition state. Also, there is no evidence for hydrogen bonding of the 2′ residue to neighbouring nucleotides or amino-acid side chains. Taken together, the drastic effects on reaction rates by 2′ modifications at the 11′ position cannot be rationalized by simple differences in sugar conformation, but by a combination of electronic and steric effects differentially affecting the transition state. Modifications of the 2′ position one nucleotide removed from the cleavage site showed less or no effect; in contrast, position 9′ showed an unanticipated threefold reduction in rate for 2′-OH and 2′-Ome ( Fig. 5a ).

Cleavage experiments were performed as described in Methods. a , 2′-fluoro-, 2′-methoxy- and 2′-hydroxyl-substitutions of single 2′-deoxyribose residues of the target DNA strand at and near the cleavage site. The control target (unmod.) was the unmodified oligodeoxynucleotide. b , Phosphorothioate modification of the target DNA. The phosphate configuration ( R P or S P ) of the phosphorothioate diastereomers is indicated. Cleavage assays were performed in the presence of either Mg 2+ or Mn 2+ cations. Note that the experiment for the 11′–12′ isomers was a different experiment, in which overall reaction rates were slower. For the complete experiment see Supplementary Fig. 25 .

To probe the role of phosphate oxygens, which can coordinate structurally or catalytically important divalent metal ions 40 , we synthesized the mixed phosphorothioate diastereomers located between residues 8′ and 9′, 9′ and 10′, 10′ and 11′, or 11′ and 12′, and purified by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) the S P form to >85%, and the R P form to >97% purity. Cleavage reactions were performed in the presence of either 5 mM Mg 2+ , which preferably coordinates to oxygen, or 5 mM Mn 2+ , which preferably coordinates to sulphur. Phosphorothioate substitution at the cleavage site, positions 10′–11′, showed the most profound effects ( Fig. 5b ). In Mg 2+ -containing buffer, the S P form was inactive and the R P form was reduced 200-fold in single-turnover cleavage rates. The loss of activity of the R P form was rescued by Mn 2+ , yielding a less than twofold reduction compared to 2′-H; however, the S P form remained inactive. Phosphorothioate substitutions more distant to the cleavage site either had no effect ( R P and S P at positions 8′–9′, S P at positions 9′–10′ and R P at positions 11′–12′), or were reduced by 15-fold and by more than 80-fold for R P at positions 9′–10′ and S P at positions 11′–12′, respectively, and rescued by Mn 2+ to less than twofold and more than 20-fold, respectively. Non-bridging phosphate oxygens that are sensitive to sulphur substitution and responsive to Mn 2+ rescue are believed to directly coordinate to Mg 2+ , and the interaction stabilizes ground and transition states of the cleavage reaction to a similar degree. A phosphate oxygen sensitive to phosphorothioate substitution, but without metal ion rescue feature, such as the pro- S P oxygen at the cleavage site, probably differentially stabilizes the transition state versus the ground state. Substituting the 10′–11′ pro- S P oxygen by sulphur increases the bond length by about 0.6 Å—distance sufficient to perturb the complex network of interactions coordinated at this phosphate oxygen ( Fig. 5c ). The pro- S P oxygen is coordinated to metal ions A and B, with A positioning the attacking hydroxyl ion nucleophile and B stabilizing the leaving 3′ oxyanion. The importance of stabilizing the leaving group was also documented earlier by the effects of modifications at the adjacent 2′ position. In contrast, the pro- R P oxygen at the cleavage site is only coordinated to metal ion A, and the sulphur substitution was rescued with Mn 2+ , indicating more flexibility for positioning the nucleophile by metal ion A.
Structural overview and functional implications

Our current structures of ternary complexes with catalytic mutants of T. thermophilus Ago have defined the positioning of the guide DNA–target RNA A-form duplex relative to the catalytic Asp residues of the RNase H fold of the PIWI domain, thereby establishing the molecular basis for site-specific cleavage at the phosphate bridging the 10′–11′ step of the target strand. Further structural studies of ternary complexes with wild-type Ago have identified two Mg 2+ cations within the catalytic pocket, located on either side of the cleavable phosphate, thereby positioned to mediate the cleavage chemistry. Both ends of the guide strand are anchored in the ternary complex composed of one turn of the DNA–RNA duplex spanning the seed segment and cleavage site, but consistent with a two-state model, the 3′-end is released from the PAZ pocket after propagation of the guide–target duplex by three additional base pairs. Notably, the guide DNA and target RNA form a regular A-form helix spanning a maximum of 15 base pairs (positions 2–16), with the Ago scaffold undergoing pivot-like domain movements as the target RNA zippers up by pairing with its guide template.

The kinetic effects of target site phosphorothioate substitution and 2′ modification during Ago-mediated DNA cleavage are rationalized by the crystal structure, and consistent with the mechanism of RNase H cleavage studied in other systems 37 . The absence of amino-acid side chains able to interrogate whether the target presented at the active site is RNA or DNA might suggest that DNA could be a more probable target of this bacterial Ago protein, as seen for other members of the retroviral integrase superfamily in which Ago proteins belong 37 .
Methods Summary

Wild-type and mutant T. thermophilus Ago proteins were overexpressed from Escherichia coli and purified by chromatography as described previously 30 . Crystals were obtained by the hanging-drop or sitting-drop vapour diffusion. The ternary Ago complex was generated in a stepwise manner by initially mixing the protein with 5′-phosphorylated 21-nucleotide guide DNA, followed by addition of different length target RNAs. All wild-type and mutant Ago complex structures were determined by molecular replacement using the domains of the binary Ago complex structure (Protein Data Bank accession code 3DLH) 30 as search models. Cleavage assays were undertaken with let-7 guide and target oligonucleotides. Details of all crystallographic and biochemical procedures are listed in Methods.
Online Methods
Crystallization and data collection

Wild-type and mutant T. thermophilus Ago were prepared as described previously 30 . Oligodeoxynucleotides were purchased from Invitrogen. RNA oligonucleotides were purchased from Dharmacon. For crystallization, T. thermophilus Ago was mixed with 5′-phosphorylated 21-nucleotide guide DNA at a 1:1.2 molar ratio, followed by the addition of different length target RNAs at a 1:1 molar ratio to the binary mixture, to form the ternary complex. All crystals were grown at 35 °C.

The mutant Ago protein complexes were crystallized by sitting-drop vapour diffusion method. Crystals of catalytic mutant Ago(Asn 546) complexed with 12-nucleotide target RNA were grown in a reservoir containing 2.5 mM spermine, 10 mM MgCl 2 , 5 mM CaCl 2 , 50 mM sodium cacodylate, pH 6.0, 10% (v/v) isopropanol. The crystals belong to space group C 2, and there is one Ago complex in the asymmetric unit. Crystals of catalytic mutant Ago(Glu 546) complexed with 15-nucleotide target RNA were grown in a reservoir containing 1.3 M ammonium tartrate dibasic and 0.1 M Bis-Tris, pH 7.0. The crystals belong to space group P 4 3 2 1 2, and there is one Ago complex in the asymmetric unit. Crystals of the catalytic mutant Ago(Asn 478) complexed with 19-nucleotide target RNA were obtained in a reservoir containing 1.0 M succinic acid, 0.1 M HEPES, pH 7.0, 1% (w/v) polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether 2,000. The crystals belong to space group P 2 1 2 1 2 1 , and there are two Ago complexes in the asymmetric unit.

Crystals of wild-type Ago complexed with 19-nucleotide target RNA with one bound divalent cation in the catalytic pocket were obtained with hanging-drop vapour diffusion method. The reservoir solution contained 50 mM MgCl 2 , 1.0 M sodium tartrate, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0. The crystals belong to space group P 4 3 2 1 2, and there is one Ago complex in the asymmetric unit. With additional 30 mM MgCl 2 in both the reservoir and Ago protein, we obtained wild-type Ago complexed with 19-nucleotide target RNA and two bound divalent cations in the catalytic pocket. These crystals belong to space group P 2 1 2 1 2 1 , and there are two Ago complexes in the asymmetric unit.

Crystals of a second crystal form of wide-type Ago complexed with 20-nucleotide RNA target containing adjacent mismatches at the 10–11 step was grown under the same conditions as described previously 31 .

Diffraction data were collected on beamline NE-CAT ID-24C at the Advanced Photon Source (APS), Argonne National Laboratory and beamline X-29 at the Brookhaven National Laboratory. All data sets were integrated and scaled with the HKL2000 suite 41 and data processing statistics are summarized in Supplementary Tables 1–3 .
Structure determination and refinement

The structures of the complexes were solved by molecular replacement with the program PHASER 42 . The domains of the Ago 21-nucleotide guide DNA binary complex structure 30 without the linkers were used as search models. Model building was done using COOT 43 , and refinement was done with CNS 44 and PHENIX 45 . The final figures were created with Pymol ( http://pymol.sourceforget.net/ ). The refinement statistics for all the Ago mutants and wild-type complexes are summarized in Supplementary Tables 1–3 .
Oligonucleotides and separation of isomers

Phosphorothioate-modified and unmodified oligodeoxynucleotides were obtained from Integrated DNA technologies. R P and S P diastereomers were separated by HPLC using a Supelco Discovery C18 column (bonded phase silica 5 μm particle, 250 × 4.6 mm) following the general method described previously 46 : buffer A was 0.1 M triethylammonium bicarbonate (TEAB, pH 7.5); buffer B was 40% acetonitrile in 0.1 M TEAB; flow rate was 1 ml min -1 . For the preparative scale ∼ 20 optical density units (ODUs) (260 nm) of oligodeoxynucleotide (that is, 20 μl of a 1 mM stock solution) were loaded on the column. Diastereomers of positions 8′–9′, 10′–11′ and 11′–12′ were separated using a two-step gradient, 0–20% B in 2 min followed by 20–40% B in 40 min (0.5% change per min). The diastereomers of positions 9′–10′ were more difficult to separate and the second step gradient was changed to 20–40% B in 80 min (0.25% change per min). Peak 1 was shown to be 97% pure by analytical HPLC (same conditions as preparative run, 0.3 ODUs injected). Peak 2 was shown to be 85% pure ( Supplementary Fig. 26 ). Dithiothreitol (DTT) was added to the collected peak fractions (1 µl 100 mM DTT to about 2 ml fraction) before dry down to minimize oxidation of the phosphorothioate. Co-evaporation with methanol was repeated three times to remove residual TEAB buffer. The dried-down material was resuspended in 50 μl water and ethanol precipitated to remove DTT. In each case peak 1 is the R P form and peak 2 is the S P form, consistent with ref. 47 . The identity of the purified diastereomers was confirmed by snake venom phosphodiesterase/alkaline phosphatase treatment and subsequent HPLC; the S P -configured dinucleotide was more resistant to phosphodiesterase compared to the R P -configured dinucleotide 48 ( Supplementary Fig. 27 ). HPLC for separation of nucleosides and dinucleotide phosphorothioates used buffer A as 0.1 M triethylammonium acetate in 3% acetonitrile, and buffer B as 90% aqueous acetonitrile. The elution was performed using a stepwise gradient starting at 0% B for 15.5 min, followed by 19.5 min of 10% B and 30 min of 100% B at a flow rate of 0.5 ml min -1 , using the same HPLC column as indicated earlier. The first four peaks are digested monomers, consistent for each oligodeoxynucleotide. Later peaks (after 30 min) are undigested dimers along with some baseline noise. Elution times of these later peaks depended on the dimer sequence and phosphorothioate configuration. In each case the R P form was more digested than the S P form ( Supplementary Fig. 27 ).
Cleavage activity assay of T. thermophilus Ago

Recombinant T. thermophilus Ago (0.5 μM final concentration) was incubated with a reaction mixture containing 10 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 0.5 μM guide strand, and 5 mM of CaCl 2 , MgCl 2 or MnCl 2 for 30 min at 55 °C in a volume of 10 μl. Then, 5′- 32 P-labelled DNA target was added to obtain the indicated final concentrations. For single turnover conditions (0.5 μM target strand) or multiple turnover conditions (5 μM target strand), unlabelled DNA target was spiked with radioactive target at a concentration of approximately 0.01 μM. The incubation was continued at 75 °C in a total volume of 15 μl. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 15 μl Stop solution (95% formamide, 50 mM EDTA and 0.02% bromophenol blue). The cleavage products were resolved on a 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gel, and radioactivity was monitored by phosphoimaging.

Editorial Summary
How Argonaute slices mRNA

One of the means by which RNA silencing downregulates gene expression is through small RNA-directed cleavage of a complementary mRNA. Argonaute family proteins are essential regulators of gene expression in plants and animals. They act by binding to single-stranded guide RNA molecules to form RISC complexes that catalyse splitting of the mRNA just where the sequence is complementary to the Argonaute-bound RNA. The crystal structure of several Thermus thermophilus Argonaute proteins mutated to inhibit cleavage activity have now been determined, in complex with a guide RNA and target RNAs of different lengths. Comparison of the various structures reveals conformational changes as the guide and target RNAs pair and suggests a mechanism for cleavage involving three aspartates and two Mg 2+ ions.
