Abstract

Argonaute proteins are conserved throughout all domains of life. Recently characterized prokaryotic Argonaute proteins (pAgos) participate in host defense by DNA interference, whereas eukaryotic Argonaute proteins (eAgos) control a wide range of processes by RNA interference. Here we review molecular mechanisms of guide and target binding by Argonaute proteins, and describe how the conformational changes induced by target binding lead to target cleavage. On the basis of structural comparisons and phylogenetic analyses of pAgos and eAgos, we reconstruct the evolutionary journey of the Argonaute proteins through the three domains of life and discuss how different structural features of pAgos and eAgos relate to their distinct physiological roles.

Argonaute (Ago) was first mentioned in a study describing a mutant in Arabidopsis thaliana 1 . Because the leaves of the mutant plant curled up like squid tentacles, the gene and corresponding protein were named after the octopus Argonauta argo . It later became clear that the Ago protein is the key player in eukaryotic RNA interference (RNAi) pathways ( Box 1 ), in which Ago utilizes short 5′-phosphorylated RNA guides to target complementary RNA transcripts. The Ago proteins belong to the PIWI protein superfamily, defined by the presence of a PIWI (P element–induced wimpy testis) domain. In addition, all eAgos feature an N (N-terminal) domain, a PAZ (PIWI-Argonaute-Zwille) domain and a MID (middle) domain, along with two domain linkers, L1 and L2 ( Fig. 1 and Box 2 ).

Box 1 RNA interference pathways

Eukaryotic RNAi pathways (reviewed in refs. 61 , 73 , 88 , 89 ) include proteins with RNase III–like domains (Dicer and Drosha) that usually process dsRNA precursors into short dsRNA molecules (small interfering (si)RNAs). With phosphorylated 5′ ends and 2-nucleotide overhangs at the 3′ ends, siRNAs consist of a passenger strand and a guide strand, and the latter is selectively loaded into eAgos. After removal of the passenger strand, eAgo holds on to the guide strand, which enables eAgo to bind mRNA targets complementary to the guide. Binding of the guide strand to Ago results in helical preordering of the seed segments in the guide (nucleotides 2–7 or 2–8), which enhances the affnity for a matching target 30 . Target binding starts in this seed region (nucleation) and extends by zippering toward the 3′ end of the guide (propagation). This results in release of the 3′ end of the guide from Ago and induces conformational changes that result in target cleavage. The cleaved target strand is released, allowing Ago to bind and cleave additional targets. In the case of imperfect targets and/or catalytically inactive eAgos, binding of eAgo, alone or with associated proteins, results in repression of mRNA translation. Both processes eventually lead to silencing of gene expression.
Box 2 Ago domains have conserved structures and functions

The core functions of each of the four structural domains of Ago proteins are well conserved in prokaryotes and eukaryotes.
The MID domain

This domain forms a basic nucleotide-binding pocket in which several conserved amino acids interact with the phosphate group at the 5′-end of the guide 5 , 19 – 22 . In addition to the specific binding of the sugar backbone of the 5′-end terminal nucleotide, at least some Agos recognize specific 5′-end bases 11 using a structural feature termed the ‘nucleotide specifcity loop’ 21 , 77 . The MID domain also stacks the guide in a helical conformation within its seed nucleotides (2–7 or 2–8), promoting target binding (reviewed in ref. 30 ).
The PIWI domain

This domain includes the RNase H–like active site of slicing Agos 6 , 16 , 18 , 22 . In the cleavage-compatible conformation, two divalent cations are bound by a DDX triad (where X is usually aspartic acid or histidine; in rare cases it is lysine 89 ). The catalytic site is completed by a glutamate residue that resides on a mobile PIWI loop (the glutamate finger), forming the DEDX motif 12 , 15 .
The PAZ domain

This domain binds the 3′ end of the guide by interactions with the backbone of nucleotides 20 and 21 (refs. 7 , 12 , 26 , 27 ). This interaction is not essential for guide binding but protects the guide from degradation 90 .
The N domain

This domain is not involved in guide loading but plays a critical role in target cleavage 35 , 66 and in the dissociation of cleaved strands 35 , 91 . During duplex RNA loading, the strand with the less stable 5′ end is retained as guide in Ago 92 , 93 . Removal of the other strand (passenger) can be slicer dependent (requires cleavage) or independent (requires mismatches or G•U wobble base pairs in the 5′ seed or in the middle of the 3′ region) 94 , 95 . In both pathways, the N domain functions as a wedge, disrupting guide-passenger base pairs at the 3′ end of the guide (active wedging) or by blocking guide-target base pairing downstream of nucleotide 16 of the guide as observed for Tt Ago ternary complexes (passive wedging) 11 , 91 . The role of the N domain in target cleavage is indicated by work on human Ago 3 (hAGO3), which is unable to cleave targets in vitro , even though it has an intact catalytic site; hAGO3 can be activated when its N domain is swapped for that of hAGO2 (ref. 66 ). Similarly, target cleavage of activated hAGO1 is enhanced when its N domain is replaced by the counterpart of hAGO2 (ref. 35 ). How the N domain facilitates slicer activity is presently unclear

Many prokaryotic genomes also feature ago genes 2 – 4 . Long pAgos encompass the same domains as eAgos, whereas short pAgos consist of only the MID and PIWI domains ( Fig. 1 ). Like eAgos, pAgos interact with 5′-phosphorylated oligonucleotides, but in contrast to eAgos, some pAgos have higher affinity for DNA guides than for RNA guides 5 – 7 . Both long and short variants of pAgos ( Fig. 1 ) have been proposed to function in defense against mobile genetic elements 4 . Indeed, it was recently shown that both RNA-guided 8 and DNA-guided 9 pAgos interfere with foreign DNA in vivo .

A major challenge in the early days of RNAi research was to uncover structure-function relationships of Ago proteins. For practical reasons, initial efforts to obtain Ago structures focused on pAgos before their physiological role was known. Those studies provided valuable mechanistic insights into guide-target pairing and guide-mediated target cleavage 7 , 10 – 12 ( Box 1 ). More recently, structures of eAgos have also been solved 13 – 15 . Here we review the body of structural work on pAgos and eAgos, and compare the features that determine their differential functionalities, such as guide preference (DNA versus RNA), nucleolytic activity and docking sites for partner proteins. We also discuss phylogenetic analyses that provide insight into how Agos have changed during their evolutionary journey, from relatively simple host-defense proteins in prokaryotes, to key players in complex multiprotein regulatory pathways in eukaryotes.

Structures of Argonaute proteins. The first crystal structures determined were of the guide-free pAgos of Pyrococcus furiosus ( Pf Ago) 16 , Aquifex aeolicus ( Aa Ago) 6 , 17 and short pAgo from Archaeoglobus fulgidus ( Af Ago) 18 , which provided information about the overall structural organization of Agos. The long pAgos revealed a bilobal architecture, with the PAZ lobe (N, L1 and PAZ domains) connected by L2 to the PIWI lobe (MID and PIWI domains). The MID domain adopts a Rossmann-like fold with a characteristic nucleotide-binding pocket 5 , 19 – 22 . The PIWI domain adopts a typical RNase H fold 6 , 16 , 18 , 22 with three catalytic aspartic acid residues, and the PAZ domain has an SH3-like barrel fold involved in nucleotide binding 23 – 25 .

Binary structure of pAgo bound to guide strand. Initial attempts to produce complexes of long pAgos with 5′-phosphorylated guide RNAs were not successful. It was later found that several pAgos bind DNA guides with affinities two orders of magnitude higher than RNA guides 5 , 6 . Crystals of Thermus thermophilus pAgo ( Tt Ago; Fig. 2a ) with a bound DNA guide ( Fig. 2b ) were eventually obtained at elevated temperatures (35–40 °C) 7 .

Guide DNA (red) and target RNA (blue) are in stick representation. ( h ) Overall view. ( i ) Bases 10 and 11 of the guide DNA are stacked.

The 3.0 Å structure of Tt Ago bound to a 5′-phosphorylated 21-mer guide DNA ( Fig. 2c ) 7 showed that the guide strand contacts all domains of Tt Ago, with the majority of the contacts involving interactions with the sugar-phosphate backbone of the guide DNA. The 5′-phosphorylated end was inserted into the nucleotide binding pocket in the MID domain ( Fig. 2d ), whereas the 3′ end of the guide was anchored in the PAZ domain ( Fig. 2e ), in agreement with previous structural reports on DNA complexes with the PIWI lobe 5 , 19 or the PAZ domain 26 , 27 . Insertion of the 5′-phosphorylated end into Tt Ago MID domain pocket strongly bends the guide strand, precluding base pairing of nucleotide 1 ( Fig. 2d ) 5 , 19 . Whereas residues lining the 5′ phosphate–binding pocket in the MID domain are critical for cleavage activity, substitution of the residues at the 3′ end–binding PAZ pocket showed little effect 7 . Guide nucleotides 2–10 in a helical arrangement ( Fig. 2c ), with bases 2–6 pointing outward and thus available for pairing with the target strand ( Fig. 2f ). These observations suggest that guide-target pairing could initiate (nucleate) in the ‘seed’ segment (nucleotides 2–8; Box 1 ), with the preformed helical conformation of the guide strand reducing the entropic penalty for duplex formation. Indeed, a guide DNA strand pairs with its target RNA with much higher affinity (~300-fold increase) when its seed fragment is associated with the A. fulgidus PIWI lobe, compared to protein-free pairing 28 . This higher affinity could enhance the fidelity of target recognition, as well as promote and stabilize the assembly of the active silencing complex. Notably, guide-target mismatches in the seed can have a pronounced impact on the affinity of guide-target recognition (reviewed in refs. 29 , 30 ). There are examples of exceptions in which the seed is not essential for target binding 31 , although the functional implications of these exceptions are not clear at present. In the binary Tt Ago structure, the preordered guide helix is interrupted by two arginine residues that lock bases 10 and 11 into a unique orthogonal arrangement ( Fig. 2g ), whereas nucleotides 12–17 of the DNA guide are disordered and could not be traced.

Ternary structures with pAgo bound to guide and target strands. Crystal structures of Tt Ago bound to a 5′-phosphorylated 21-mer DNA guide and complementary RNA targets of different lengths provided a major step in understanding Ago functionality. In order to prevent target cleavage, either mismatches were introduced in nucleotides 10 and 11 centered on the cleavage site 10 , or one of the three aspartic acid residues that line the cleavage pocket were substituted 11 . The ternary complex of Tt Ago with a 12-mer target RNA ( Fig. 2b ) encompassed 11 Watson-Crick base pairs in an A conformation, spanning nucleotides 2–12 and including the seed segment and the cleavage site ( Fig. 2h ). In the guide strand, both the 5′ phosphate and the 3′ end remained anchored in their respective MID and PAZ pockets; in contrast, the orthogonal arrangement of bases 10 and 11 seen in the binary complex was disrupted in the ternary complex, where they appeared stacked and centered on the cleavage site ( Fig. 2i ). Pivot-like conformational transitions are observed for the N and PAZ domains from binary to ternary complex formation with the 12-mer RNA target 10 , 11 .

In structures of the ternary complexes of Tt Ago with a 15-mer RNA target (3.0 Å resolution; Fig. 3a – e ) or with a 19-mer RNA (2.8 Å resolution; Fig. 3f – h ), the 5′-phosphate end of the guide remained anchored in the MID pocket, but the 3′ end of the guide was released from the PAZ pocket 11 . This release was required to overcome torsional constraints that accumulate during the propagation step ( Box 1 ), as longer target segments enter the Ago interior to form an uninterrupted A-form duplex with the guide strand (14 base pairs (bp) with the 15-mer RNA target; 15 bp with the 19-mer RNA target). Release of the 3′ end of the guide is accompanied by rotation of the PAZ domain ( Fig. 3c ) and transitions within the nucleic acid–binding surface of the PIWI domain, namely movements in loops PL1, PL2 and PL3 ( Fig. 3d ), and a sliding and flipping of a β-strand ( Fig. 3e ). The ternary complex of Tt Ago with the 19-mer target RNA shows that the N domain blocks guide-target pairing beyond position 16 ( Fig. 3h ) 11 . Altogether, the structures of Tt Ago ternary complexes with RNA targets illustrate the conformational transitions during the progression from nucleation to propagation steps of guide–target duplex formation.

Structures of ternary complexes of DNA-guided Tt Ago with target DNAs have been solved to a substantially higher resolution (2.2 Å) 12 than those with RNA targets. A glutamic acid residue on loop PL2 (termed the ‘glutamate finger’ 15 ) is directed away from the catalytic pocket in the cleavage-incompatible conformation (i.e., in the guide-free protein, in the binary complex and in the ternary complex with 12-nucleotide targets; Fig. 4a ). However, in the cleavage-compatible conformation (i.e., ternary complexes with targets at least 15-mer RNA or 16-mer DNA; Fig. 4b ), this glutamic acid is inserted into the catalytic pocket and completes the catalytic tetrad 12 . The two-state model of Argonaute action has been confirmed by single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer studies with Methanocaldococcus jannaschii pAgo ( Mj Ago) 32 . A pair of Mg 2+ cations facilitate RNA hydrolysis in RNase H family nucleases 33 , 34 , but no metals were detectable in the cleavage-incompatible forms of Tt Ago ( Fig. 4c ). In contrast, two Mg 2+ cations were identified in the cleavage-compatible conformations in the complex with the 16-mer DNA target ( Fig. 4d ), where they bridged the catalytic aspartic acid residues and the cleavage site on the target strand, i.e., the backbone phosphate between nucleotides 10 and 11 of the target strand, where cleavage takes place. In addition, a water molecule was observed at a position allowing for an in-line attack on the cleavable phosphate group ( Fig. 4d ) 12 , and the catalytic glutamic acid is coordinated to the Mg 2+ cation B through two bridging water molecules 12 ; in contrast, in RNase H, the glutamic acid directly interacts with the divalent cation 34 . In Tt Ago, insertion of the glutamic acid in the catalytic pocket results in cleavage of the target strand between the nucleotides that base pair with guide nucleotides 10 and 11 (ref. 12 ). These structural snapshots of ternary Tt Ago complexes provide a model for Mg 2+ cation– coordinated cleavage of the target strand ( Fig. 4c – f ).

Binary structures of eAgos bound to guide strands. Sustained efforts have resulted in the successive crystallization and structural determination of budding yeast Kluyveromyces polysporus Ago ( Kp Ago, 3.2 Å; Fig. 5a ) 15 , human AGO2 (hAGO2, 2.2 Å; Fig. 5b ) 13 , 14 and human AGO1 (hAGO1, 1.75–2.3 Å) 35 , 36 , all with fortuitously loaded heterogeneous RNA guides. hAGO1 and hAGO2 were also captured as binary complexes by replacing the co-purified RNA with a defined RNA guide: hAGO1 with let-7 at 2.1 Å, and hAGO2 with miR-20a at 2.2 Å 13 , 35 . Although the eAgo structures are currently restricted to binary complexes, biochemical studies have demonstrated the capacity of Kp Ago to load RNA duplexes, which is followed by cleavage of the passenger strand, and eventually annealing and slicing of a complementary target strand 15 .

( h ) A pair of tryptophan-binding pockets on the surface of hAGO2 in its binary complex with a fortuitously loaded 5′-phosphorylated guide RNA (PDB 4EI3 ).

In these eAgo binary complex structures, both the bases and the phosphate backbone spanning the seed segment could readily be traced, even with bound heterogeneous RNA. Similar to DNA guides in Tt Ago, the seed segments of eAgo-bound RNA guides adopt an A-like conformation, which in eAgos is facilitated by hydrogen bond interactions involving the 2′-OH and phosphate groups of the RNA guide to Ago. In all studied eAgo complexes, there is a kink between nucleotides 6 and 7 of the RNA guide, caused by the insertion of the side chain of an isoleucine residue ( Fig. 5c ). To allow guide pairing with RNA targets, this isoleucine side chain has to be displaced during ternary complex formation. Isoleucine or other hydrophobic residues are often found at this position, but they are not strictly conserved. The bases spanning the seed segment are stacked with an unusual tilting in the binary eAgo complexes 13 – 15 , requiring transition to a nontilted A-like helical state to facilitate pairing with the target strand in the ternary complex. Akin to the arginine-mediated perturbation of nucleotides 10 and 11 in Tt Ago with a bound DNA guide 7 , base stacking at nucleotides 9 and 10 is perturbed in the complex of hAGO2 with RNA guide, with the kinked alignment stabilized by three arginine side chains ( Fig. 5d ) 13 . Yet another similarity with the binary Tt Ago structures concerns the disordered middle part (nucleotides 11–19) of the guides in the eAgo binary complexes, whereas their 3′ ends are bound by the PAZ domain 13 , 14 .

Differences between eAgo and pAgo complexes. Despite low sequence similarity between pAgos and eAgos (12% identity between various pAgos and hAGO2), their structural and functional features are remarkably similar ( Box 2 ). Nevertheless, there are also notable structural differences that seem to correlate with distinct functionalities 37 . Whereas all characterized eAgos and some pAgos use RNA guides 8 , other pAgos use DNA guides 5 , 6 , 9 , 32 . The only chemical difference between RNA and DNA nucleotides is that at the 2′ position of the sugar ring, RNA has an OH group, whereas DNA has an H group. The eAgo PAZ domain does not bind the 2′-OH groups in the 3′ end of the RNA guide 26 , 27 , but some of the 2′-OH groups spanning the seed segment are specifically bound (either directly or via water-mediated hydrogen bonds) to the MID, L1 and PIWI domains ( Fig. 5e ) 13 – 15 , 35 , 36 . This indicates that the preference for an RNA guide is determined at the structural level, although those 2′-OH–binding residues are conserved only in a narrow group of fungal and metazoan eAgos. In addition, the 5′-phosphate binding pocket of the Tt Ago MID domain is more hydrophobic than that of hAGO2, which might explain preference of Tt Ago for DNA guides 14 . In the 5′ end–binding pocket of pAgos, the negative charge of two phosphates of the guide (nucleotides 1 and 3) and of the C-terminal carboxyl group of pAgo (which is inserted into the MID domain binding pocket) are neutralized by a bound divalent cation 19 (reviewed in ref. 22 ). In contrast, fungal and metazoan eAgos use the ammonium group of a conserved lysine to neutralize this charge 37 .

In the Kp Ago and hAGO2 binary complexes, the glutamate finger is inserted into the catalytic pocket, even in the absence of the target strand 13 – 15 . This is in contrast with pAgos, in which insertion of the glutamate finger to complete the catalytic tetrad follows extended guide-target base pairing, leading to the cleavage-compatible state. Notably, a hydrogen bond network in eAgo stabilizes the expanded and repositioned glutamate-containing loop in the activated state ( Fig. 5f ), with the same alignment in cleavage-compatible pAgo ( Fig. 5g ), thereby facilitating insertion of the glutamate finger into the binding pocket 15 . Further experimentation is required to define the constraints controlling cleavage activity of eAgo.

The catalytically active pAgos appear to function as stand-alone proteins, but eAgos interact with a range of proteins in a variety of RNAi pathways (see below). External insertion segments present in eAgos, but not in pAgos, likely provide binding surfaces for RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) subunits 15 . KpAgo contains 19 insertion segments, of which 11 are conserved segments (cSs) found in all eAgos and 8 are variable segments (vSs) found only in a subset of eAgos 15 . At least some of the cSs are essential for silencing 38 or appear to differentially affect the activity of eAgos. Although a gap between the two structural lobes is observed in Tt Ago, cS1, cS3 and cS10 in Kp Ago generate a subdomain that fills this gap 15 . The presence of this subdomain positions the N domain away from the nucleic acid–binding channel, which allows extensive guide-target pairing and accommodation 15 . In hAGO1, cS7 forms a surface that could sterically hinder the positioning of a fully paired guide-target RNA duplex in the catalytic site 36 . In the catalytically activated hAGO1(R805H) variant, activity is further increased upon swapping specific cS7 residues with those of hAGO2 (refs. 35 , 36 ). Structures of hAGO1 and hAGO2 have revealed that other cSs in the PIWI domain form two tryptophan-binding pockets, lined by aromatic and hydrophobic side chains ( Fig. 5h ), which are implicated in binding Gly-Trp (GW) repeats of TNRC6 family proteins (for example, GW182) that promote miRNA-mediated translation regulation (deadenylation) by hAGO1 (refs. 14 , 36 , 39 ). Indeed, GW-rich peptides from GW182 can target these pockets in eAgo 40 , with the distance between pockets matching the pairwise arrangement of tryptophan residues in GW proteins. Thus, eAgo-specific insertion segments play a role in the binding of interacting proteins and additionally can directly influence eAgo activity.

Evolution and function of Argonaute proteins

The evolutionary journey of the Agos has produced Ago protein families with distinct distribution patterns across the domains of life. Ago is encoded in ~65% of the sequenced eukaryotic genomes, dispersed over at least four of the five eukaryotic supergroups 3 , 41 . In contrast, a recent position-specific iterative basic local alignment search tool (PSI-BLAST) search of the RefSeq database (November 2013) using representative PIWI domain sequences as queries shows that Ago proteins are encoded in ~32% and ~9% of the available archaeal and bacterial genomes, respectively, and in 17 of 37 prokaryotic phyla. Similarly to most prokaryotic defense genes 42 , pAgo shows a patchy distribution, with at most 70% representation in any bacterial or archaeal phylum.

Both eAgos and pAgos belong to the PIWI-protein superfamily, which is defined by the presence of a PIWI domain and in some cases a PAZ domain 2 ( Fig. 1 ). The presence of the PIWI lobe in all Ago proteins detected so far implies that it is essential for Ago functionality 4 , 41 . We have thus used the sequences of only the MID and PIWI domains to build maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees using the FastTree program 43 ( Fig. 6 and Supplementary Data 1 – 4 ). We discuss below how this phylogeny can be linked to the structural features that are either conserved or lost in the different families.

Evolution of prokaryotic Argonautes

The topology of the phylogenetic tree of pAgos and most of its sub-trees does not follow the prokaryote phylogeny derived by analysis of ribosomal RNA and other universal genes. This pattern suggests extensive horizontal gene transfer of pAgo-encoding genes, similar to the evolution of most prokaryotic defense genes 42 , 44 . The topology of the tree is congruent with the domain architectures of pAgo and the organization of the (predicted) operons containing pAgo genes ( Fig. 6a , and Supplementary Data 1 and 2 ). As shown previously 4 , the tree can be confidently divided into two major branches: the short pAgo branch consists of short pAgos only, and the long pAgo branch contains all long pAgos and some short pAgos (for example, Af Ago). The latter variants are scattered over the long Ago branch, suggestive of multiple, independent truncation events 4 . Notably, long pAgos from several euryarchaeal species, mostly thermophiles, group with eAgos, supporting previous conclusions on the origin of eAgos from euryarchaeal pAgos 3 , 4 .

On the basis of the conservation of the four catalytic residues, only 28% of the long pAgos are predicted to be catalytically active; these predicted active pAgos form a monophyletic group ( Fig. 6a ), and the encoding genes often co-occur with predicted helicases. Predicted catalytically inactive long pAgo proteins often cluster in predicted operons with genes encoding putative nucleases ( Box 3 ). Assuming that the ancestral pAgo was an active nuclease and that the primary split in the evolution of this family was the separation into short and long forms ( Fig. 6a , solid red arrow), Agos were inactivated on multiple independent occasions, which resulted in loss of activity in all short pAgos and several groups of long Agos, including a subset of eAgos. Alternatively, as the root of maximum likelihood method–generated phylogenetic trees cannot be determined, the correct root position might be between the active and inactive forms ( Fig. 6a , dotted red arrow); in this scenario, truncation of pAgo to yield the short forms would be a relatively late evolutionary event.
Box 3 Predicted nucleases and helicases associated with pAgos

Genes encoding long pAgos with incomplete catalytic sites are often clustered in predicted operons with genes encoding putative nucleases of the Sir2 or Mrr families, predicted to be DNA-specifc nucleases, with different catalytic motifs 96 – 98 .

Genes encoding long pAgos with intact catalytic sites occasionally cluster with genes encoding Cas4-like or PLD domain nucleases. Cas4 is a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-associated nuclease/helicase, likely involved in the adaptation step of CRISPR-Cas host defense 99 , 100 , whereas phospholipase D (PLD) family nucleases are fused to a DNA/RNA helicase domain, a combination also found in bacterial restriction-modifcation systems 101 . Other predicted long pAgo operons encode Schlafen-like ATPases, which are putative DNA/RNA helicases 102 .

All genes encoding short pAgos are associated with a gene encoding the uncharacterized APAZ (analog of PAZ) domain ( Fig. 1 and Fig. 6a ). APAZ lacks detectable sequence similarity with the PAZ domain and has only been detected in the context of short pAgo genes, always fused to a (predicted) nuclease domain that may belong to the Sir2 or Mrr protein families (from different subfamilies than the ones associated with long pAgos) or to TIR domains 4 . The latter are predicted to possess nuclease activity 4 , 103 and are involved in bacterial virulence 104 or in eukaryotic antimicrobial and antiviral response, and in apoptosis 105 – 107 . In some prokaryotic genomes, the putative Sir2 nuclease is fused not only to the APAZ domain but also to pAgo itself ( Fig. 6a ). Less commonly, Sir2-APAZ domains contain an inserted Schlafen-like ATPase domain (Sir2-Schlafen-APAZ; Fig. 6a ). Moreover, some short pAgo genes cluster with Mrr-TIR-APAZ gene fusions.

PIWI-RE proteins are fused to an uncharacterized N-terminal domain that does not appear to be related to either PAZ or APAZ 41 . In many genomes, genes encoding PIWI-RE are clustered with two genes, encoding a DinG-like helicase and a predicted restriction endonuclease 41 . Given that DinG family helicases specifcally act on R-loops 108 , the PIWI-RE proteins have been hypothesized to function as part of an RNA-guided restriction system 41

Approximately 60% of the identified pAgos lack the PAZ lobe, and most of these short pAgos have incomplete catalytic tetrads. All genes in the short pAgo branch are associated with a gene encoding the uncharacterized APAZ (Analog of PAZ) domain ( Fig. 1 and Fig. 6a ) 4 . The APAZ domain does not have detectable sequence similarity with the PAZ domain and has not been detected in any context other than the short pAgo neighborhood. The N terminus of the APAZ domain is always fused to a (predicted) nuclease domain ( Box 3 ) 4 .

A highly diverged family of short pAgo derivatives, designated PIWIRE for characteristic conserved arginine (R) and glutamic acid (E) residues 41 ( Fig. 1 ), appears in a few major bacterial lineages. Notably, the set of genomes encoding PIWI-RE or pAgo show almost no overlap 41 . Similar to short pAgos, most PIWI-RE proteins feature a seemingly inactive PIWI lobe. PIWI-RE proteins are fused to an uncharacterized N-terminal domain that does not appear to be related to PAZ or APAZ 41 . In many genomes, PIWI-RE-encoding genes cluster with DinG-like helicases and predicted nucleases ( Box 3 ), and thus the PIWI-RE proteins have been hypothesized to be part of an RNA-guided restriction system 41 .

Function of prokaryotic Argonautes

The ability to cleave target nucleic acids in vitro has been investigated for four long pAgos from different branches in the Argonaute tree, namely Tt Ago, Aa Ago, Mj Ago and Rhodobacter sphaeroides pAgo ( Rs Ago). Tt Ago utilizes DNA guides to cleave single-stranded (ss)RNA, ssDNA and/or double-stranded (ds)DNA plasmid targets, the latter by independently nicking the two strands 9 . Aa Ago utilizes ssDNA guides to cleave ssRNA strands, but its ability to cleave DNA has not been determined 6 , 17 . Mj Ago utilizes ssDNA guides to cleave ssDNA strands but cannot cleave RNA targets 32 . No catalytic activity has been observed for Rs Ago 8 , but it co-occurs with a predicted nuclease in R. sphaeroides .

Although the physiological functions of Aa Ago and Mj Ago have not yet been determined, both Tt Ago and Rs Ago play a demonstrated role in host defense 8 , 9 . Tt Ago lowers plasmid transformation efficiency and intracellular plasmid concentrations in T. thermophilus 9 . Notably, Rs Ago lowers intracellular plasmid concentrations in Escherichia coli but not in R. sphaeroides ; however, it does interfere with plasmid-encoded RNA in R. sphaeroides 8 . As short DNA molecules complementary to the RNA guides associate with Rs Ago in vivo , a yet-to-be-identified nuclease has been proposed to process DNA bound by Rs Ago-RNA complexes 8 . Tt Ago and Rs Ago both acquire functional guides when expressed in E. coli 8 , 9 , which suggests that guide processing is performed either by pAgo itself or by common host factors. Tt Ago utilizes 13–25-nt small interfering DNA (siDNA) guides and appears to depend on its own catalytic site for guide loading 9 , whereas catalytically inactive Rs Ago acquires 15–19-nt RNA guides proposed to originate from degraded mRNAs 8 . Most guides acquired by Tt Ago and Rs Ago are complementary to foreign DNA, such as plasmids or insertion elements 8 , 9 .

The frequent association of homologous (predicted) nucleases with catalytically inactive long or short pAgos ( Box 3 ) suggests a modular organization of pAgo-centered defense systems, with occasional recombination between loci encoding different variants of these systems ( Fig. 6a ). In some of these pathways, the long pAgo is predicted to possess both target recognition and nuclease activities. In other cases, catalytically inactive long or short pAgo might be responsible only for target recognition (using at least their MID and PIWI domains), whereas cleavage would be performed by other nucleases encoded in the same operons, which possibly physically interact with pAgo. The presence of additional non-nuclease genes near some genes encoding pAgos ( Box 3 ) indicates the requirement for additional activities in those systems. Given that Tt Ago requires unwinding of dsDNA targets for subsequent cleavage of each strand 9 , pAgo-associated helicases could play a role in enhancing the accessibility of dsDNA targets for pAgo-mediated cleavage.

Evolution and function of eukaryotic Argonautes

We also reconstructed a phylogenetic tree using a representative set of eAgos with pAgo sequences as an outgroup ( Fig. 6b , and Supplementary Data 3 and 4 ). In agreement with previous analyses 45 , 46 , eAgos can be divided into four major families: the Trypanosoma Ago family 46 , typified by Trypanosoma brucei ; the WAGO family, typified by worm ( Caenorhabditis elegans )-specific Agos; the Ago-like family, typified by Arabidopsis thaliana AGO1; and the PIWI family, typified by Drosophila melanogaster PIWI. The Ago-like and PIWI families are represented in several major groups of eukaryotes, indicating that at least one duplication of eAgo apparently antedated the last common ancestor of the extant eukaryotes. The other two families could have emerged as a result of additional, lineage-specific duplications. Another protein family belonging to the PIWI-protein superfamily was recently identified in eukaryotes 41 ; these proteins have only the MID domain and an inactive PIWI domain, and are typified by Med13, a subunit of the transcription regulatory Mediator complex in mammals 47 .

The phylogenetic tree of eAgos generally follows the phylogeny of eukaryotes and, given the rarity of horizontal gene transfer in the evolution of eukaryotes, it appears that eAgos evolved solely by vertical inheritance. Thus, it has been inferred that a functional RNAi pathway, consisting of eAgo, Dicer and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), was present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor, where it most likely functioned in defense against viruses and transposons 3 . Dicer consists of RNase III, PAZ and DExD/H helicase domains, all with identifiable ancestors in prokaryotes, whereas RdRP apparently evolved from a group of so-far uncharacterized, predicted DNA-dependent RNA polymerases from bacteriophages 3 .

All eAgos function in larger protein networks that vary substantially between and within the different families, and eAgos have evolved into distinct players in these different networks. This diversification is the result of many sequence adaptations, which allow interactions with a multitude of proteins involved in either guide processing, guide loading, regulating eAgo activity or recruitment of additional proteins.

Trypanosoma Ago family. This eAgo family is mainly studied in T. brucei , in which long dsRNA guide precursors are expressed both from retrotransposons 48 and chromosomal 147-bp tandem units 49 . These transcripts are processed either by a cytoplasmic Dicer ( Tb DCL1; ref. 50 ), which depends on Tb RIF5 for activity 51 , or by a nuclear Dicer ( Tb DCL2; ref. 52 ). The exonuclease Tb RIF4 is essential in converting the duplex siRNAs to ssRNA guides 51 . An N-terminal RGG domain allows Tb AGO1-guide complexes to associate with polyribosomes, which results in efficient cleavage of retrotransposon transcripts 53 . Thus, like the prokaryotic Rs Ago, Trypanosoma family Agos interfere with transposon activity.

WAGO family. The eAgos of this nematode-specific family generally act as so-called secondary Argonaute proteins, i.e., they are loaded with guide RNAs in response to the activity of the primary Ago protein 54 . In C. elegans , a primary Ago protein (for example, RDE-1 or PRG-1) is believed to recruit an RdRP to the targeted mRNA, which results in the synthesis of new guide RNAs, known as 22G RNAs (22-nt guides with 5′-ppp-G), that are used by WAGO proteins. As direct products from RdRP activity, 22G RNAs carry 5′-triphosphate (GTP) groups 55 , 56 , and it remains unclear how the WAGO proteins can accommodate this atypical guide RNA feature. The WAGO proteins execute a variety of silencing mechanisms, from target RNA destabilization 54 to transcriptional silencing 57 . Absence of secondary Agos can be enough to desilence target expression 54 , 57 , which suggests that the action of the primary Ago is not sufficient for silencing. A notable case has been reported in which a WAGO protein seems to protect against silencing activities executed by other WAGO proteins 58 , 59 . Hence, apart from adapting to various mechanisms of guide RNA acquisition and target silencing, eAgos seem to play a role in counteracting or fine-tuning silencing.

Ago-like family. Guide RNAs are typically processed and loaded into Ago-like proteins by proteins such as Dicer (reviewed in refs. 60 , 61 ). In some cases (such as vertebrate AGO2 proteins), Ago-like proteins themselves perform secondary processing of preprocessed RNA hairpin structures, through their endonucleolytic activity 62 , 63 . Many Ago-like proteins use endogenous guide RNAs, known as microRNAs (miRNAs), to regulate gene expression, mainly by affecting mRNA translation elongation, acting as a road block for the ribosome, or by affecting polyadenylation of the mRNA by extensive interactions with 3′ untranslated region–processing machineries (reviewed in refs. 64 , 65 ). In these cases, the guide-target interactions are often characterized by limited, imperfect base-pairing that is incompatible with target RNA cleavage 29 . Thus, many eAgos act purely as sequence-specific RNA-binding proteins, whose sole function is to counteract the translation of specific mRNAs.

Once loaded with a guide, many Ago-like proteins function without involvement of other proteins. Based on the conservation of the four active site residues, ~90% of eAgos are predicted to be catalytically active. However, it should be noted that not all Agos with complete catalytic tetrads are catalytically active, as hAGO3 harbors all four residues but cannot cleave targets in vitro 35 , 66 . Catalytically inactive hAGO1 can be activated by minimal changes in the active site, with the activity further enhanced by mutations in either the N domain 35 , 66 or cS7 (refs. 35 , 36 ). These findings are compatible with a scenario in which an ancestral eukaryote inherited an active long pAgo, whose catalytic function was subsequently lost in a subset of eAgos. In plants and in some animals, Ago-like proteins use target RNA cleavage as a gene-regulatory mechanism 65 and have been shown to interfere with dsRNA viruses 67 – 70 ; the latter role is reminiscent of the host-defense functions of pAgos. However, in contrast to pAgos, eAgo-like proteins depend on other proteins, such as Dicer, to process guides from the viral dsRNA genome. Even when confronted with similar guide-target RNA interactions, the kinetics of binding and releasing target RNA can vary widely between different eAgos 71 , which indicates that they have not only evolved to bind different protein-partners but also adapted biochemically to execute distinct functions.

PIWI family. The ancestral function of target cleavage is strongly conserved among the PIWI-like proteins. Many PIWI family members use their guide RNAs, known as piRNAs, to control the activity of transposable elements within the germ cells of animals 72 . In contrast to the Ago-like proteins, animal PIWI-like proteins are loaded through a pathway that includes ssRNA precursors (reviewed in ref 73 ). This process requires many different protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions, and takes place in extremely protein- and RNA-rich assemblies that flank nuclear pores. In some cases, this process involves a nuclease from the PLD family 74 ( Box 3 ); in others, a member of the PIWI-like family itself catalyzes precursor processing. These endonu-cleases generate 5′-phosphorylated RNA fragments that are bound by a PIWI-like protein. However, not all PIWI-like proteins employ such mechanisms: for example, the PIWI-like proteins in ciliates, which are involved in sequence-specific genome rearrangements, are loaded through Dicer-dependent pathways 75 , 76 . These variations illustrate the high flexibility in molecular mechanisms coupled to eAgos.

Some, but not all of the PIWI-like proteins display a strong preference for a uracil at the 5′ end of the loaded RNA, likely reflecting the presence of a nucleotide-specificity loop 21 , 77 , as described for some plant Ago proteins 78 . After loading of this piRNA intermediate, the 3′ end of the loaded RNA is likely trimmed by an exonuclease 79 and then 2′-O-methylated 80 . Crystal structures of the PAZ domain of PIWI-like proteins have revealed the basis of preference for RNA guides with a 2′-O-methylation at their 3′ ends over those with unmodified 2′-OH groups 81 , 82 . The 2′-O-methyl modification has also been demonstrated in guide RNAs of some members of the Trypanosoma Ago and Ago-like families, including Tb AGO1, Dm AGO2 and all the Agos in plants 83 – 85 . A common property of these eAgos is that their guides extensively pair with their target RNAs, resulting in release of the 3′ end of the guide RNA from the PAZ domain and potentially rendering the guide RNA exposed to 3′ end–modifying activities. Indeed, in the absence of 2′-O-methylation, target recognition by these Ago-like proteins results in exonuclease trimming, adenylation and uridylation of the guide RNA 86 , which could all affect guide RNA stabilities 87 .

Concluding remarks

Comparison of available pAgo and eAgo structures reveals that the domain architecture and the functions of individual domains are conserved throughout the three domains of life. The MID and PIWI domains are responsible for binding and helical preordering of the RNA or DNA guide. Short pAgos, with only these two domains, most likely function as guide-mediated target binders and depend on associated nucleases (and possibly helicases) for target cleavage and/or unwinding. Long pAgos and eAgos feature additional PAZ domain, which binds the 3′ end of the guide, and the N domain, which plays a role in unwinding of the guide–passenger duplex and interferes with guide-target base pairing toward the 3′ end of the guide.

The evolutionary journey of the Agos started in prokaryotes, through a fusion of a PIWI-like RNase H domain with a MID-like nucleic acid–binding domain, yielding the first guide-dependent short pAgo ( Fig. 6 ). RNase H is a nearly ubiquitous nuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of a DNA-RNA duplex during replication in all domains of life. After the RNase H–MID fusion to generate a short Ago protein, there were additional associations with distinct interaction or enzymatic domains, often as N terminally–fused extensions, such as N-PAZ in long pAgos, nuclease-APAZ in short pAgos, or the unique N-terminal domain in PIWI-RE ( Fig. 1 ). In different pAgo clades, these associations engendered multiple, independent variations, which resulted in active and inactive variants with different guide and target specificities. So far, two mechanistic pAgo functions have been characterized experimentally: DNA-guided DNA interference by Tt Ago and Mj Ago and RNA-guided DNA interference by Rs Ago, an inactive pAgo variant associated with an uncharacterized nuclease. The Tt Ago protein binds both DNA-RNA and DNA-DNA guide-target duplexes in an A-form helix, which is unusual for DNA duplexes. Notably, RNase H cleaves DNA-RNA helices, which also adopt the A conformation, suggesting that Tt Ago retained the ancestral preference for an A-form helix in the course of evolution. The guide and target specificity of Argonaute variants cannot be currently predicted from their amino acid sequence. Most of the prokaryotic MID-PIWI– containing systems likely function in defense against invading DNA, whereby target cleavage is performed either by their PIWI domain or by co-occurring nucleases ( Box 3 ). Given the variation of genes that cluster with pAgo, the functions of pAgos and partner proteins might extend beyond host-defense to various regulatory pathways.

A major step in Argonaute evolution appears to have been the transition from stand-alone proteins to multiprotein regulatory systems. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that the last eukaryotic common ancestor possessed not only an RNA-guided RNA-interfering Ago but also all other components essential for RNAi 3 . In the course of evolution, eAgos maintained the four domains and their respective functions (although some lost catalytic activity) but additionally acquired insertion segments that allowed optimization of specific protein-protein interactions, while maintaining the basic molecular mechanism of action. Thus, various eAgos evolved to interact with pathway-specific proteins, resulting in a variety of RNAi pathways involved in a wide range of cellular processes. The functions of many insertion segments are not yet known, and both structural and biochemical research is required to reveal their roles. Elucidation of these missing links will contribute to our growing understanding of the evolution, mechanism and physiology of Agos, and of the diverse defense and regulatory systems of prokaryotes and eukaryotes in which these proteins play crucial roles.
