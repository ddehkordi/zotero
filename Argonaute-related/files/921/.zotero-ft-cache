Abstract

The members of the ancient family of Argonaute (Ago) proteins are present in all domains of life. The common feature of Ago proteins is the ability to bind small nucleic acid guides and use them for sequence-specific recognition – and sometimes cleavage – of complementary targets. While eukaryotic Ago (eAgo) proteins are key players in RNA interference and related pathways, the properties and functions of these proteins in archaeal and bacterial species have just started to emerge. We undertook comprehensive exploration of prokaryotic Ago (pAgo) proteins in sequenced genomes and almost tripled the number of previously analyzed genes of this family. In comparison with eAgos, pAgos are highly diverse and have likely spread by horizontal gene transfer. Many pAgos contain divergent variants of the conserved domains involved in interactions with nucleic acids and in target cleavage, while having extra domains that are absent in eAgos, suggesting that they might have unusual specificities in the nucleic acid recognition and processing. Many pAgos, including catalytically inactive variants, are associated with putative nucleases, helicases and DNA binding proteins in the same gene or operon, suggesting that they are involved in DNA processing. The great diversity of pAgos revealed by our analysis opens new ways for exploration of their functions in host cells and their use as potential tools in genome editing.

* The Clinical Trials and Epidemiology subject categories are now closed to new submissions following the completion of bioRxiv's clinical research pilot project and launch of the dedicated health sciences server medRxiv (submit.medrxiv.org) . New papers that report results of Clinical Trials must now be submitted to medRxiv. Most new Epidemiology papers also should be submitted to medRxiv, but if a paper contains no health-related information, authors may choose to submit it to another bioRxiv subject category (e.g., Genetics or Microbiology).
