	abstract = {Summary
Target recognition in {RNA} silencing is governed by the “seed sequence” of a guide {RNA} strand associated with the {PIWI}/{MID} domain of an Argonaute protein in {RISC}. Using a reconstituted in vitro target recognition system, we show that a model {PIWI}/{MID} domain protein confers position-dependent tightening and loosening of guide-strand-target interactions. Over the seed sequence, the interaction affinity is enhanced up to ˜300-fold. Enhancement is achieved through a reduced entropy penalty for the interaction. In contrast, interactions 3′ of the seed are inhibited. We quantified mismatched target recognition inside and outside the seed, revealing amplified discrimination at the third position in the seed mediated by the {PIWI}/{MID} domain. Thus, association of the guide strand with the {PIWI}/{MID} domain generates an enhanced affinity anchor site over the seed that can promote fidelity in target recognition and stabilize and guide the assembly of the active silencing complex.},

Argonaute is the core constituent of the silencing effector complexes {RISC} ({RNA}-induced silencing complex) and the {RITS} complex ({RNA}-induced initiation of transcriptional gene silencing complex), interacting directly or indirectly with Dicer proteins, R2D2/Loquacious/{TRBP} and {GW}182 family proteins in the former, and Chp1 and Tas3 in the latter. In a breakthrough series of papers, Patel et al. provide a set of 'molecular snapshots' of the catalytic cycle of Argonaute, exploiting mismatches and mutants to capture and visualize by X-ray crystallography Argonaute from Thermus thermophilus with guide and target strands at various stages of the silencing process. The structural studies, coupled to structure-directed biochemical analysis, together with other thermodynamic and kinetic studies, provide insights into Argonaute with implications for the mechanisms of {RNA} silencing in eukaryotes.},

The common feature of Ago proteins is the ability to bind small nucleic acid guides and use them for sequence-specific recognition – and sometimes cleavage – of complementary targets. While eukaryotic Ago ({eAgo}) proteins are key players in {RNA} interference and related pathways, the properties and functions of these proteins in archaeal and bacterial species have just started to emerge. We undertook comprehensive exploration of prokaryotic Ago ({pAgo}) proteins in sequenced genomes and almost tripled the number of previously analyzed genes of this family. In comparison with {eAgos}, {pAgos} are highly diverse and have likely spread by horizontal gene transfer. Many {pAgos} contain divergent variants of the conserved domains involved in interactions with nucleic acids and in target cleavage, while having extra domains that are absent in {eAgos}, suggesting that they might have unusual specificities in the nucleic acid recognition and processing. Many {pAgos}, including catalytically inactive variants, are associated with putative nucleases, helicases and {DNA} binding proteins in the same gene or operon, suggesting that they are involved in {DNA} processing. The great diversity of {pAgos} revealed by our analysis opens new ways for exploration of their functions in host cells and their use as potential tools in genome editing.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Despite the essential role of Ago in gene regulation and defense against virus, the molecular mechanism of guide-strand loading into Ago remains unclear. We explore such a mechanism in the bacterium Thermus thermophilus Ago ({TtAgo}), via a computational approach combining molecular dynamics, bias-exchange metadynamics, and protein−{DNA} docking. We show that apo {TtAgo} adopts multiple closed states that are unable to accommodate guide-{DNA}. Conformations able to accommodate the guide are beyond the reach of thermal ﬂuctuations from the closed states. These results suggest an induced-ﬁt dominant mechanism for guide-strand loading in {TtAgo}, drastically diﬀerent from the two-step mechanism for human Ago 2 ({hAgo}2) identiﬁed in our previous study. Such a diﬀerence between {TtAgo} and {hAgo}2 is found to mainly originate from the distinct rigidity of their L1-{PAZ} hinge. Further comparison among known Ago structures from various species indicates that the L1-{PAZ} hinge may be ﬂexible in general for prokaryotic Ago’s but rigid for eukaryotic Ago’s.},

We found that target binding of core-{RISC} starts at the seed region, resulting in four distinct reaction pathways: target cleavage, transient binding, stable binding, and Argonaute unloading. The target cleavage requires extensive sequence complementarity and dramatically accelerates core-{RISC} recycling. The stable binding of core-{RISC} is efﬁciently established with the seed match only, providing a potential explanation for the seed-match rule of {miRNA} ({microRNA}) target selection.

We show that {RsAgo} can speciﬁcally recognize both the ﬁrst nucleotide in {gRNA} and complementary nucleotide in {tDNA}, and both interactions contribute to nucleic acid binding. Non-canonical pairs and bulges on the target strand can be accommodated by {RsAgo} with minimal perturbation of the duplex but signiﬁcantly reduce {RsAgo} afﬁnity to {tDNA}.

	abstract = {The {RNAi} pathway provides both innate immunity and efﬁcient gene-knockdown tools in many eukaryotic species, but curiously not in zebraﬁsh. We discovered that {RNAi} is less effective in zebraﬁsh at least partly because Argonaute2-catalyzed {mRNA} slicing is impaired. This defect is due to two mutations that arose in an ancestor of most teleost ﬁsh, implying that most ﬁsh lack effective {RNAi}. Despite lacking efﬁcient slicing activity, these ﬁsh have retained the ability to produce {miR}-451, a {microRNA} generated by a cleavage reaction analogous to slicing. This ability is due to a G–G mismatch within the ﬁsh {miR}-451 precursor, which substantially enhances its cleavage. An analogous G–G mismatch (or sometimes also a G–A mismatch) enhances target slicing, despite disrupting seed pairing important for target binding. These results provide a strategy for restoring {RNAi} to zebraﬁsh and reveal unanticipated opposing effects of a seed mismatch with implications for mechanism and guide-{RNA} design.},

	abstract = {Thermus thermophiles Argonaute ({TtAgo}) is a complex, which is consisted of 5′-phosphorylated guide {DNA} and a series of target {DNA} with catalytic activities at high temperatures. To understand why high temperatures are needed for the catalytic activities, three molecular dynamics simulations and binding free energy calculations at 310, 324, and 338K were performed for the {TtAgo}-{DNA} complex to explore the conformational changes between 16-mer guide {DNA}/15-mer target {DNA} and {TtAgo} at different temperatures. The simulation results indicate that a collapse of a small β-strand (residues 507–509) at 310 K caused Glu512 to move away from the catalytic residues Asp546 and Asp478, resulting in a decrease in catalytic activity, which was not observed in the simulations at 324 and 338 K. The nucleic acid binding channel became enlarged at 324 and 338K, thereby facilitating the {DNA} to slide in. Binding free energy calculations and hydrogen bond occupancy indicated that the interaction between {TtAgo} and the {DNA} was more stable at 324K and 338K than at 310 K. The {DNA} binding pocket residues Lys575 and Asn590 became less solvent accessible at 324 and 338K than at 310 K to inﬂuence hydrophilic interaction with {DNA}. Our simulation studies shed some light on the mechanism of {TtAgo} and explained why a high temperature was needed by {TtAgo} during gene editing of {CRISPR}.},

Our studies establish that single-base bulges 7T8, 5A6 and 4A5 on the guide strand are stacked-into the duplex, with conformational changes localized to the bulge site, thereby having minimal impact on the cleavage site. By contrast, single-base bulges 6’U7’ and 6’A7’ on the target strand are looped-out of the duplex, with the resulting conformational transitions shifting the cleavable phosphate by one step. We observe a stable alignment for the looped-out 6’N7’ bulge base, which stacks on the unpaired ﬁrst base of the guide strand, with the looped-out alignment facilitated by weakened Watson–Crick and reversed non-canonical ﬂanking pairs. These structural studies are complemented by cleavage assays that independently monitor the impact of bulges on {TtAgo}-mediated cleavage reaction.},

Results from microsecond {MD} simulations of 15 diﬀerent {siRNA}−{hAGO}2 complexes provide insights about how the key noncovalent interactions and conformational changes at the seed region are modulated, depending upon the nature and position of chemical modiﬁcations. Such modiﬁcation induced structural changes can aﬀect {siRNA} loading into {hAGO}2, which may inﬂuence {RNAi} activity.

Despite intensive studies, molecular mechanisms of how Ago recognizes {miRNA} remain largely elusive. In this study, we propose a two-step mechanism for this molecular recognition: selective binding followed by structural re-arrangement. Our model is based on the results of a combination of Markov State Models ({MSMs}), large-scale protein-{RNA} docking, and molecular dynamics ({MD}) simulations. Using {MSMs}, we identify an open state of apo human Ago-2 in fast equilibrium with partially open and closed states. Conformations in this open state are distinguished by their largely exposed binding grooves that can geometrically accommodate {miRNA} as indicated in our protein-{RNA} docking studies. {miRNA} may then selectively bind to these open conformations. Upon the initial binding, the complex may perform further structural re-arrangement as shown in our {MD} simulations and eventually reach the stable binary complex structure. Our results provide novel insights in {AgomiRNA} recognition mechanisms and our methodology holds great potential to be widely applied in the studies of other important molecular recognition systems.},

We reveal that the 50-end anchoring of the guide strand, and the sequence complementarity in the seed- and mid-regions greatly accelerate the target binding, and that this acceleration is due to the reduction of the entropic barrier of the binding process.

Biochemical assays have demonstrated that Argonaute functions by modulating the binding properties of its {miRNA} guide so that pairing to the seed region is exquisitely fast and accurate. However, the mechanisms used by Argonaute to reshape the binding properties of its small {RNA} guide remain poorly understood. Here, we identify a structural element, a-helix-7, in human Argonaute2 (Ago2) that is required for speed and fidelity in binding target {RNAs}. Biochemical, structural, and single-molecule data indicate that helix-7 acts as a molecular wedge that pivots to enforce rapid making and breaking of {miRNA}:target base pairs in the 30 half of the seed region. These activities allow Ago2 to rapidly dismiss off-targets and dynamically search for seed-matched sites at a rate approaching the limit of diffusion.},

Small interfering {RNAs} ({siRNAs}) are {RNA} molecules that play an effector role in {RNAi} and can bind the {PAZ} domains present in Dicer and {RISC}. We investigated the interaction between the {PAZ} domain and the {siRNA}-like duplexes through dissociation molecular dynamics ({DMD}) simulations. Speciﬁcally, we focused on the response of the {PAZ} domain to various 30-overhang structures of the {siRNA}-like duplexes. We found that the {siRNA}-like duplex with the 30 {UU}-overhang made relatively more stable complex with the {PAZ} domain compared to those with 30 {CC}-, {AA}-, and {GG}-overhangs. The {siRNA}-like duplex with {UU}-overhang was easily dissociated from the {PAZ} domain once the structural stability of the complex is impaired. Interestingly, the 30 {UU}-overhang spent the least time at the periphery region of the binding pocket during the dissociation process, which can be mainly attributable to {UU}-overhang’s smallest number of hydrogen bonds.},

	abstract = {Background: The Argonaute protein is the core component of the {RNA}-induced silencing complex, playing the central role of cleaving the {mRNA} target. Visual inspection of static crystal structures already has enabled researchers to suggest conformational changes of Argonaute that might occur during {RNA} interference. We have taken the next step by performing an all-atom normal mode analysis of the Pyrococcus furiosus and Aquifex aeolicus Argonaute crystal structures, allowing us to quantitatively assess the feasibility of these conformational changes. To perform the analysis, we begin with the energy-minimized X-ray structures. Normal modes are then calculated using an all-atom molecular mechanics force field.
Results: The analysis reveals low-frequency vibrations that facilitate the accommodation of {RNA} duplexes – an essential step in target recognition. The Pyrococcus furiosus and Aquifex aeolicus Argonaute proteins both exhibit low-frequency torsion and hinge motions; however, differences in the overall architecture of the proteins cause the detailed dynamics to be significantly different.
Conclusion: Overall, low-frequency vibrations of Argonaute are consistent with mechanisms within the current reaction cycle model for {RNA} interference.},

The active site is comprised of three distinct loops loop-6, loop-7 and loop-8. Based on loop-6 and loop-7 conformation we describe the enzyme as Open {TIM} and Closed {TIM}. Various {NMR}, X-ray crystallography and {QM}/{MM} simulation techniques have provided glimpses of individual events of what is essentially a dynamic process. We studied the conformational changes of two distinct loops (loop-6 and loop-7) enveloping the active site, in the presence of natural substrate, reaction intermediates and inhibitor molecules, by means of microsecond atomistic {MD} simulations in solution and crystal environment. Our studies have revealed that loop-6 samples open and closed conformations in both apo and holo {TIM} structures. As seen in solution state {NMR} experiments, we also observe that loop-6 N-terminus and C-terminus move independently. In our simulations we have also observed that backbone dihedrals of loop-7 residues G210 (G210-phi, G210-psi) and G211 (G211-phi) sample open and closed states in both apo and holo {TIM} structures. Whereas backbone dihedral angles of G211 (G211-psi) and S212 (S212phi) adopt closed conformation only when the ligand is bound to the active site. As observed in chain-B of 1R2R crystal structures, we also observe that water molecules can also initiate flip of G211-psi and S212-phi dihedral angles into closed conformation. Except, loop-5, which has a dominant effect on the conformational behaviour of loop-6 N-terminus, we do not observe any influence of either loop-6 or loop-7 on the conformational dynamics of the other.},

	abstract = {{RNA} interference ({RNAi}), mediated by small non-coding {RNAs} (e.g., {miRNAs}, {siRNAs}), influences diverse cellular functions. Highly complementary {miRNA}-target {RNA} (or {siRNA}-target {RNA}) duplexes are recognized by an Argonaute family protein (Ago2), and recent observations indicate that the concentration of Mg2+ ions influences {miRNA} targeting of specific {mRNAs}, thereby modulating {miRNA}-{mRNA} networks. In the present report, we studied the thermodynamic effects of differential [Mg2+] on slicing ({RNA} silencing cycle) through molecular dynamics simulation analysis, and its subsequent statistical analysis. Those analyses revealed different structural conformations of the {RNA} duplex in Ago2, depending on Mg2+ concentration. We also demonstrate that cation effects on Ago2 structural flexibility are critical to its catalytic/functional activity, with low [Mg2+] favoring greater Ago2 flexibility (e.g., greater entropy) and less {miRNA}/{mRNA} duplex stability, thus favoring slicing. The latter finding was supported by a negative correlation between expression of an Mg2+ influx channel, {TRPM}7, and one {miRNA}’s ({miR}-378) ability to downregulate its {mRNA} target, {TMEM}245. These results imply that thermodynamics could be applied to {siRNA}-based therapeutic strategies, using highly complementary binding targets, because Ago2 is also involved in {RNAi} slicing by exogenous {siRNAs}. However, the efficacy of a {siRNA}-based approach will differ, to some extent, based on the Mg2+ concentration even within the same disease type; therefore, different {siRNA}-based approaches might be considered for patient-to-patient needs.},

The seed segment (positions 2 to 8) adopts an A-helical-like Watson–Crick paired duplex, with both ends of the guide strand anchored in the complex. An arginine, inserted between guide-strand bases 10 and 11 in the binary complex, locking it in an inactive conformation, is released on ternary complex formation. The nucleic-acid-binding channel between the {PAZ}- and {PIWI}-containing lobes of argonaute widens on formation of a more open ternary complex. The relationship of structure to function was established by determining cleavage activity of ternary complexes containing position-dependent base mismatch, bulge and 2′-O-methyl modifications. Consistent with the geometry of the ternary complex, bulges residing in the seed segments of the target, but not the guide strand, were better accommodated and their complexes were catalytically active.},

We disclose the conformational transition of Cas9 from its apo form to the {RNA}-bound form, suggesting a mechanism for {RNA} recruitment in which the domain relocations cause the formation of a positively charged cavity for nucleic acid binding. {GaMD} also reveals the conformation of a catalytically competent Cas9, which is prone for catalysis and whose experimental characterization is still limited.

	abstract = {Argonaute proteins repress gene expression and defend against foreign nucleic acids using short {RNAs} or {DNAs} to specify the correct target {RNA} or {DNA} sequence. We have developed single-molecule methods to analyze target binding and cleavage mediated by the Argonaute:guide complex, {RISC}. We ﬁnd that both eukaryotic and prokaryotic Argonaute proteins reshape the fundamental properties of {RNA}:{RNA}, {RNA}:{DNA}, and {DNA}:{DNA} hybridization—a small {RNA} or {DNA} bound to Argonaute as a guide no longer follows the well-established rules by which oligonucleotides ﬁnd, bind, and dissociate from complementary nucleic acid sequences. Argonautes distinguish substrates from targets with similar complementarity. Mouse {AGO}2, for example, binds tighter to {miRNA} targets than its {RNAi} cleavage product, even though the cleaved product contains more base pairs. By re-writing the rules for nucleic acid hybridization, Argonautes allow oligonucleotides to serve as speciﬁcity determinants with thermodynamic and kinetic properties more typical of {RNA}-binding proteins than of {RNA} or {DNA}.},

	abstract = {{RNA} silencing refers to a group of widespread gene-regulatory pathways rooted in many facets of eukaryotic biology, including brain development, stem-cell and germ-line maintenance, and cancer progression. At the molecular level, {RNA}-silencing pathways, such as the {RNA} interference ({RNAi}) and {microRNA} ({miRNA}) regulatory pathways, are mediated by a specialized family of {RNA}-binding proteins named Argonaute. Argonaute proteins are uniquely capable of binding small regulatory {RNAs} and using the encoded sequence information to locate and silence complementary target {RNAs}. The versatility and power of {RNA} silencing arises from the fact that Argonaute can be loaded with a small {RNA} of any sequence and thus can be programmed to target essentially any {RNA} for silencing. Here, we review current understanding of Argonaute proteins in terms of molecular structure, function, and mechanism.},

	abstract = {{MicroRNAs} ({miRNAs}) broadly regulate gene expression through association with Argonaute (Ago), which also protects {miRNAs} from degradation. However, {miRNA} stability is known to vary and is regulated by poorly understood mechanisms. A major emerging process, termed target-directed {miRNA} degradation ({TDMD}), employs specialized target {RNAs} to selectively bind to {miRNAs} and induce their decay. Here, we report structures of human Ago2 ({hAgo}2) bound to {miRNAs} and {TDMD}-inducing targets. {miRNA} and target form a bipartite duplex with an unpaired ﬂexible linker. {hAgo}2 cannot physically accommodate the {RNA}, causing the duplex to bend at the linker and display the {miRNA} 30 end for enzymatic attack. Altering 30 end display by changing linker ﬂexibility, changing 30 end complementarity, or mutationally inducing 30 end release impacts {TDMD} efﬁciency, leading to production of distinct 30-{miRNA} isoforms in cells. Our results uncover the mechanism driving {TDMD} and reveal 30 end display as a key determinant regulating {miRNA} activity via 30 remodeling and/or degradation.},

Argonaute binding alters the properties of an {RNA} guide, creating functional domains. We show that the domains established by Argonaute—the anchor, seed, central, 30 supplementary, and tail regions—have distinct biochemical properties that explain the differences between how animal {miRNAs} and {siRNAs} bind their targets. Extensive complementarity between an {siRNA} and its target slows the rate at which ﬂy Argonaute2 (Ago2) binds to and dissociates from the target. Highlighting its role in antiviral defense, ﬂy Ago2 dissociates so slowly from extensively complementary target {RNAs} that essentially every fully paired target is cleaved. Conversely, mouse {AGO}2, which mainly mediates {miRNAdirected} repression, dissociates rapidly and with similar rates for fully paired and seed-matched targets. Our data narrow the range of biochemically reasonable models for how Argonaute-bound {siRNAs} and {miRNAs} ﬁnd, bind, and regulate their targets.},
